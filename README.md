# Market Regime Detection using Hidden Markov Models

This project applies a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify latent market regimes in the S&P 500 index.

Financial markets exhibit structural changes over time, including periods of low volatility, high volatility, crises, and transitional dynamics. Traditional time series models assume constant parameters, while regime-switching models allow the underlying data-generating process to evolve.

This notebook implements a probabilistic state-space framework to:

- Detect hidden market regimes
- Estimate regime-dependent return distributions
- Analyze transition dynamics
- Measure regime persistence
- Forecast short-term regime probabilities

The methodology integrates financial econometrics, statistical learning, and time series modeling.
